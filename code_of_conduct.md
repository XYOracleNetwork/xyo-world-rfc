# Code of Conduct

## XYO Foundation Pledge to Community

We strive to create and maintain a development culture which fosters an open and welcoming environment for all developers. Maintainers in the development team at XYO pledge to making participation in our projects and our community a harrassment-free experience for all developers regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 

## XYO Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to cultivating a positive environment:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Focus on what is best for the community 
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Show empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, derogatory comments, insults, personal or political attacks
-   Harassment of any kind whether public or private
-   Publishing someone's private information of any kind without explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting 

## XYO Responsibilities

Our Code of Conduct applies in all forums whether in open source project spaces or in any public space where one is representing a project, community, or organization. Examples include using email in an official basis, whether from a project team or organization, posting to official social media accounts, or acting as a representative at any events, meetups or gatherings of any kind whether online or offline. Project maintainers may further define these roles and responsibilities.

This Code of Conduct should also be applied as necessary to address and correct an individual's behavior which is negatively impacting a project, community, or organization including XYO. 

## Conflict Resolution

XYO does not believe that all conflict is bad; in fact, healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the our Code of Conduct.

If there is a violation of the Code of Conduct, it is encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more autonomy over the outcome. If this matter cannot be resolved, it must be reported to the community manager. If the community manager is involved it must be reported to someone of equal or greater authority. 

XYO will investigate every complaint. However, understand that some resolutions may not receive direct responses, rather, the situation (without identifying complainants) may be addressed in public to the community to address the negative behavior and/or update the Code of Conduct. In more potentially harmful situations we may take action without notice and conduct any needed investigations without notice. 

Depending on the complaint and its severity, we may take no action up to permanent expulsion from project(s), communities, and organization(s).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
