# XYO WORLD RFC

As a new project utilizing XYO, the XYO Foundation is actively developing this process. This is an evolving document as the community settles on features to add, features are implemented, and bugs/design issues are addressed. 

The RFC process helps to encourage healthy discussion around proposed features, design, constraints, and implememtation. 

**NOTE** Some changes may not require an RFC: 

- Bug fixes
- Refactoring code 

## Process 

To start the process of adding a feature to XYO World, you need to initiate a pull request with a markdown file. The file must conform to the template standard included in the repo. The RFC will only be active (added as a feature) once it has been merged into the XYO WORLD RFC repo. A merge will only happen once a revie has been completed by 2 or more parties, and the last call for review date has passed. Accepted RFCs **do not** guarantee feature implementation.

Before starting on an RFC and initiating the pull request: 

- Fork the repo - https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/xyo-world-rfc.git
- Follow the `XYOW-0000-template.md` in creating your RFC, but be sure to create a new file and replace `template` with your proposal title, do not change the number `0000` as adminsitrators will handle the labeling after RFC acceptance. 

## The RFC Life-cycle 

## RFC Implementation

## RFC Review

While the RFC is in pull request review it is considered in `draft` status.  

XYO World's process is inspired by the Rust RFC Process, the Ember RFC Process, the Yarn RFC Process, and the Ethereum EIP Process.
